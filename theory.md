Exercise 1 - Theory questions
-----------------------------
 
 ### What is the difference between concurrency and parallelism?
 > *Concurrency is executing several tasks at the same time, but not necessarily simultaneously. Meaning that multiple tasks can start, run and complete in overlapping time. While parallellism is running different tasks at the same time. The difference is that parallelism is doing multiple things at the same time, and concurrency is dealing with multiple things at the same time.*
 
 ### Why have machines become increasingly multicore in the past decade?
 > *Had trouble making the processors faster, so the soulution was to make the machines multicore. In this way we have more comuting power and can run different tasks at the same time, parallelism. This will therefore speed up the process.*
 
 ### Why do we divide software (programs) into concurrently executing parts (like threads or processes)?
 (Or phrased differently: What problems do concurrency help in solving?)
 > *Several computations are executed in overlapping time periods. Makes the computations faster.*
 
 ### Does creating concurrent programs make the programmer's life easier? Harder? Maybe both?
 (Come back to this after you have worked on part 4 of this exercise)

 ### What is the conceptual difference between threads and processes?
 > *Your answer here*
 
 ### Some languages support "fibers" (sometimes called "green threads") or "coroutines"? What are they?
 > *Your answer here*
 
 ### What is the Go-language's "goroutine"? A C/POSIX "pthread"?
 > *Your answer here*
 
 ### In Go, what does `func GOMAXPROCS(n int) int` change? 
 > *Your answer here*
